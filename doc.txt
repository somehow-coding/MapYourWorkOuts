Api part just understand this.
api stands for application programming interface.
it provides an interface for applications to interacte.
so lets say we use weather API.

load/use weather details -> js code(passing parameters and calling api) -> eg: weather API(weather details)

future prospect for the project:
I am thinking of creating functionalities like, delete and update details and can add destination details also.

mapty details:
it is a website developed using html css and js, where u can keep your workout details.
when you open this website it asks for accessing location to get current location, when you click on the 
map over a box appears on the left part and there u can fill your work out details.

your workout details are stored in browser's local storage.It is soted using local storage api so that you can see
workout details at a glance.
to load this map we have used one open js library leaflet and as I have said earlier we have current location
using geolocation API.

result we have kept workout details:
running: distance, time, speed.
cycling: elevation gain, duration, distance.
